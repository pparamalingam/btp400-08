This project is a desktop client for Google Maps using the Google Maps Static API. The client is developed in Java using Swing
for the user interface. The features are as follows:
- Zooming
- Panning
- Address Lookup
- Path Calculation Between Two Points (shortest path)

Project Updates
----------------

- Have to fix warnings in current build (not mandatory according to pliu)
- Embeded map into app and added zoom in and zoom out buttons (March 18 2012)
  * Overall look of the app will not be handled until near completion
  * May add history funtionality to avoid constant querying of Google servers (time premitting)
  
- Finally configured EGIT with MAC, need to set up on Windows
- Configured EGIT with Windows
